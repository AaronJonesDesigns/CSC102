    <!-- There are 3 ways to include CSS in our page
     * External CSS - the CSS styles are in a separate .CSS file - best practice
       Embedded CSS - the CSS styles apply to just 1 page - <style  </style? ; okay to use sparingly
       Inline CSS - set styles on a particular HTML element - very time consuming to update; try to avoid at all costs-->
