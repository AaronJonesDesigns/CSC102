    <h2>Functions</h2>

    <script>
        
        // this is the JavaScript function definition; we need to use the keyword function
        // functions are awesome - you write code 1 time and can reuse it throughout your program
        // function name should usually be some sort of action
        // always include th () - sometimes there will be variable(s) in between the () or they may be empty
        // always make sure there are a matching set of curly braces { }
        function runCalc(){
            // whatever code is in between the curly brace
            // we will create a variable called num1, and we will
            // JavaScript should assume that this is a numberic
            var num1 = 0;
            var num2 = 0;

            // we want to promt the user for a number, using the built in JavaScript prompt function
            // the prompt function takes an argument (variable) - the text that will be shown to the user with the prompt
            // the prompt funtion returns the value that the user entered in
            // set the num1 variable equal to the value the user entered in

            do{
            
                // make the user enter a number; this loop will run until a number is entered
                num1 = prompt("Please enter number 1: "); // Most lines of JavaScript need a ; at the end
                // if isNotaNumber is true (they entered text) or the user entered 0 the loop will keep running
                }while(isNaN(num1) || num1 == 0); //this ; is mandatory
            

            // get another number from the user and assign it to the num2 variable
            num2 = prompt("Please enter number 2 "); //most lines of JavaScript need a ; at the end

            // let's add num1 and num2 together and stroe that value in the total variable
            //The built in JavaScript function parseInt makes sure that JavaScript treats the num1 and num2 variables as integers (whole numbers)
            var total = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2);
        
            // call the build in JavaScript function called alert - this will show a message to the user
            // it should show our numbers and the total
            alert("The total of " + num1 + " plus " + " is " + total);
        }
        // we have created the function, now we need to call it so that the function code will run
        // the () are blank because we don't need to pass any information into this function
        runCalc();

    </script>
    <h2>Decision Logic (if/else)</h2>

    <script>
        // creating a variable called age with a default value of 5
        // 1 equals sign is assignment, the variable on the left is assigned the value on the right      

        var age = 7;
        // 2 equals signs means check for equality, or deas the value on the left side match the value on the right side
        if (age == 5){
            // this code will run if the value of the age variable is 5
            alert("age=" + age);
        }
        // else if will be checked when the iff statemnet does not evalutate to true
        else if (age == 6){
            // this code will run if the value of the age variable is 6
            alert("age=" + age)
        }
        // the else statement is a catch-all, it will run if none of the if/else if statements are true
        else{
            // this code will run if the value of the age variable is anything other than 5 or 6
            alert("age was not 5 or 6");
        }

    </script>

    <h2>Loops</h2>
    <script>
        // loops run code repeatedly
        // they are great for desplaying data
        // there are 2 basic types of loops - for loop and while loops

        // for loops are generally used when you know how many times you want the code to run
        // 1st part of our for loop is a count variable, and we are setting it to a default value of 0
        // 2nd part the condition that for loop will test on each run the loop will run as long as this condition is true
        // 3rd part is incrementing the counter variable each time the loop runs
        // i++ is the same thing as i = i + 1
        for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++){
            alert("i=" + i);

        }

        // counter variable, set to default value of 0
        var counter = 0;
        // while loop will run until the counter is equal to 5
        while(counter < 5){
            // display the value of counter in an alart
            alert("counter=" + counter);

            // increase the value of counter by 1 every time the while loop
            counter++;

        }
        // while loops are generally used when you do not know how many times you want the code to run
